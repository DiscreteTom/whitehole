//! The basic building block of a parser.
//!
//! Each [`Action`] is a small piece of parsing logic that
//! digest some bytes from the input, optionally change the state of the parsing,
//! and yield a value.
//!
//! For most cases, you don't need to use [`Action`] directly.
//! See [`Combinator`](crate::combinator::Combinator) and
//! [`Parser`](crate::parser::Parser) for more high-level APIs.
