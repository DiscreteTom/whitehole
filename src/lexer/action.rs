//! ## Design
//!
//! For a better engineering experience, the lexer is designed to be modular
//! and consists of many [`Action`]s. Each action is a small piece of logic
//! which will digest some bytes from the rest of the text input, and optionally yield a token.
//! By doing so, users can easily compose their own lexer by re-using existing actions.
//! Users can also share their actions with others by publishing them as a library,
//! or build higher-level libraries to generate actions.
//!
//! ## For Developers
//!
//! Here is the recommended order of reading the source code:
//!
//! 1. [`self::input`]
//! 2. [`self::output`]
//! 3. [`self`]
//! 4. [`self::decorator`]
//! 5. [`self::simple`]
//! 6. [`self::utils`]
