// there should NOT be an `Action::or(Action)` to merge actions,
// because if we implement that, we need to merge two actions' head matcher,
// however the head matcher should NOT be modified since some actions may rely on it.
// e.g. suppose we have an action that only accept one character based on the head matcher
// and don't check the `input.rest` in the `exec`, then give the output a data
// `SubAction::new(|_| Some(1)).into().head_in(['a']).data(|_| 1)`
// merge it with `SubAction::new(|_| Some(1)).into().head_in(['b']).data(|_| 2)`
// the head matcher will be merged to `OneOf(['a', 'b'])` and the action will accept both 'a' and 'b'
// but when the `input.rest` starts with 'b', the action will accept it and set data to `1`
// which is incorrect.

// there should NOT be an `Action::and_then(Action)` either,
// because if we implement that, we should ignore the second action's head matcher,
// however the head matcher should NOT be ignored since some actions may rely on it.
// e.g. suppose we have an action that only accept one character based on the head matcher
// and don't check the `input.rest` in the `exec`
// `SubAction::new(|_| Some(1)).into().head_in(['a'])`
// if we use the action as the second action, the head matcher is ignored and
// the action will accept any character, which is incorrect.

// however, since `SubAction` has no head matcher and other fields,
// there could be `Action::and_then(SubAction)`. we use `Add` to implement this.
