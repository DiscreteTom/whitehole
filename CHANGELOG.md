## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `Combinator!(@T)` and `Combinator!(Kind, @T)` syntax.
- Add `Combinator::range` to include the byte range of digested text in the output.
- Add `Combinator::when` as the opposite of `Combinator::prevent`.

### Changed

- Rename `Node` to `WithRange`, rename its field `kind` to `data`.
- Rename `Parse` to `Action`, rename its method `parse` to `exec`.
- Make generic param `State` and `Heap` of the `Parse` trait become associated type.
- Rename `Action::Kind` to `Action::Value`, rename `Output::kind` to `Output::value`.
- Plain closures are no longer supported as `Action` trait implementations. Use `wrap` instead to create a `Combinator` from a closure.
- Simplify generic params of `Combinator` and `Parser`.
- `Parser::parse` and `Parser::peek` will return `parse::Output` instead of `WithRange`.

### Removed

- Remove `combinator::Builder`.
- Remove `Combinator!(_, State, Heap)` syntax.

## [0.0.1] - 2024-11-24

- Overloaded operators: `|`, `+` and `*` for `Combinator`.
- The basic `Parser`, with `Builder`, `Instant` and `Snapshot` support.
